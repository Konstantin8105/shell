The program "eshell" computes deformations and internal forces
of axisymmetric shells.

Usage:
======

eshell <data.file


Results:
======== 

If no random data are defined in the input file then results
in nodes are send to the standard output (in a gnuplot-friendly
form).
It some random are defined then input data for the "monte"
are send to the standard output and results are sent to
standard error output.


Conventions:
============

Input data format:
==================

number_of_materials 
number_on_nodes
number_on_elements
number_of_displacements
number_of_forces

E1 E2 G nu1 nu2 gravity_force volume_price width (one line per material)
....

Note: it the width > 0 the it overwrites element widths

X1 Y2 (one line per node)
X1 Y2
....

node1 node2 material width  (one line per element)

node direction size (one line per displacement/support)
....

node direction size (one line per force)
....

water_top water_bottom water_volume_force min_elem_number max_elem_number (only one line, min_ and max_ can be 0)

Type_of_failure_criteria
Number_of_parameters
par1 par2...

Number of random variables

Type Position Item
....

See README.RANDOM for details: only input variables
have to be defined.


Notes:
======

Supports directions are:
0 ... Y displacemement
1 ... X displacemement
2 ... rotation
3 ... Y stiffness
4 ... X stiffness
5 ... rotation stiffness

Forces are:
0 ... Y force
1 ... X force
2 ... moment
